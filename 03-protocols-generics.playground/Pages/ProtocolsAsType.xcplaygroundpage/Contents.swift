//  Protocols as Types
//  Protocols don’t actually implement any functionality themselves. Nonetheless, any protocol you create will become a fully-fledged type for use in your code.

//  Because it’s a type, you can use a protocol in many places where other types are allowed, including:

//  As a parameter type or return type in a function, method, or initializer
//  As the type of a constant, variable, or property
//  As the type of items in an array, dictionary, or other container”
